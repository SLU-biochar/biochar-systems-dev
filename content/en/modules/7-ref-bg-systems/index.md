title: "7 - Reference and background systems"
description: "
The environmental performance of a given biochar production process & biochar application is not intrinsic to it. 


In fact, environmental performance depends of the context in which we are set (so called background system). Besides, environmental performance is always relative and ought to be compared to alternative equivalent systems or reference systems.


This module will explain and illustrate these two statements.
