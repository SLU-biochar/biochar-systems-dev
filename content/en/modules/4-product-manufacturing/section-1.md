## **Biochar used in ...**

<div class="col-md-4">

### **Agricultural products**

Beside direct application of biochar to soil, biochar can be returned to soil in various ways.

**Biochar compound fertilisers**: biochar can be combined with organic or mineral fertilisers to form engineered fertilisers, both solid or liquid. 

Solid biochar-based fertilisers can be granules or pellets, which are applied to soil by spreading. 

Liquid biochar-fertilisers involve adding powder biochar to a nutrient-rich liquid such as slurries. The liquid mixture is then spread on fields either via irrigation techniques or existing machinery for liquid fertiliser injection.

**Animal feed**: several companies have developped biochar animal feed (e.g. poultry, dairy, horse, but also cats and dogs). 

**Co-amendment**: biochar can be combined with compost or animal manure, before applications.

### **Urban landscaping products**

In urban areas, biochar is being used as a component for landscaping applications. 

**Component in maccadam-soil blends**: biochar, compost and maccadam blends provide an aerated tree planting substrate well-suited for paved areas because of its mechanical properties. It has been in use in Stockholm since the early 2010s.

**Component in mineral soils for green roofs**: biochar is also being used as a component in mineral soils (i.e. made of clay, lava stones, and similar mineral components), suited for extensive green roofs. 

**Component in mineral other landscaping soils**: biochar is also blended with compost and other minerals to provide an alternative to peat-based landscaping soils.

### **Other industrial products**

**Additive in cement, concrete, and asphalt**: biochar with specific properties and particle size can be used as an additive in cement and concrete products, replacing other components, and sometimes leading to improved or similar mechanical properties. Biochar addition to asphalt has also been investigated.

**Component of water filters**: biochar from various types of wood can be used as a carrier for biofilm growth, used in water treatment, with equivalent or improved performance relative to sand filters or other biofilm carriers.

**Additive in plastics**: biochar powder has also been used as an additive in plastic manufacturing, leading e.g. to improved mechanical properties and the ability to cast thinner products, reducing the use of plastic per unit of product.
