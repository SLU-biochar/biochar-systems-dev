## **Modelling in life cycle assessment**
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">

At the biochar product manufacturing stage, the life cycle considerations are:

1. Identify the functions of the biochar-product (*e.g. 1 plastic pot of 50 cm<sup>3</sup> for horticulture*)

2. Identify alternative products delivering an equivalent function (*e.g. conventional plastic pot, paper-based pot*)

3. Note any quality differences in the functions delivered (*e.g. biodegradability of pot, resistance to moisture during storage or use*)

4. Quantify material use, energy use, tranpsortation, but also direct emissions during manufacturing, for the biochar-based product and its alternatives.

Such modelling was performed in our [Uppsala case]({{< ref "case-studies/4-uppsala.md" >}}), describing various biochar-products used in urban areas in Sweden.
