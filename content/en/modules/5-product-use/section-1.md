## **Biochar effects when used in agriculture**


<div class="col-md-6">

The effects arising from biochar use in agriculture are diverse. Most effects relate to biochar use in soils, as opposed to effects relating to, for instance, uses in animal husbandry, manure management, or horticulture.

In the LCA literature, several of the environmental impacts of these biochar use-phase effects have been modelled. We list them below, from most to least commonly modelled:
- Fertilizer use reduction (both N and P fertilizers)
- Soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission reduction
- Increase in crop harvest
- Soil organic carbon priming (increase in soil carbon stocks following biochar addition)
- Soil CH4 emission changes (increase or decrease depending on soil types; usually a decrease for paddy fields)
- Reduced leaching of nitrate to water
- Reduced need for limestone production and use (due to biochar's liming effect)
- Effects on animal health and enteric fermentation

More details are presented in [Azzi et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112154).

There are several challenges associated with modelling of biochar agricultural effects:
- **effects vary with time**: some effects can last multiple years before they fade out, e.g. liming effect, crop yield increases; while other effects may only last one agricultural season or persist indefinitely. In general, there is a lack of long-term studies. This hinders modelling of multi-annual effects in biochar LCAs.  

- **effects are multiple and interrelated**: as illustrated in the figure below, biochar can affect soil water processes, various biological processes, the soil structure, the availability of nutrients and contaminants. The interaction of these effect, in combination with external factors like climate and human interventions, is what leads to an observed crop productivity or environmental impact. LCA often seek to quantify those final effects rather than describe the complex intermediary effects.

- **effects vary with the agroecosystem considered**: each agroecosystem, with its given soil type, climate or agricultural practice, may respond differently to a given biochar use. This diversity adds a layer of complexity in LCA modelling. Biochar agricultural effects require the context of the study to be very precise, which limits applicability of results to other contexts.
