## **Biochar effects when used in urban landscaping products**


<div class="col-md-8">

Urban uses of biochar are also associated with various effects. A few will be illustrated here.

***Biochar used for urban tree plantings***

Biochar is nowadays routinely used in Stockholm and other cities in Sweden to plant trees in urban paved areas. The constructed soil is made of 80% of macadam (stones) and about 20% of a blend of biochar and compost (in equal parts), in volume. The constructed soil is very porous, and rainwater is chanelled through the planting beds. This tree planting technique is studied for its effects on tree growth, tree mortality, but also stormwater quality and quantity. This said, the data available to date is to scarce to be able to quantify the environmental benefits of these effects.

***Biochar used for green roof***

Biochar is also used for production of sedum green roofs. Biochar is one of the component of the mineral soil used to grow. A claim made by the manufacturer is that biochar-based green roofs require fertilisation only every second year, while conventional green roofs would require it annually. The green roofs, due to increase water holding capacity, are expected to reduce runoff of stormwater.

The first effect described (fertiliser use reduction) is simple to include in LCA. The second effect is more challenging to model as data is more scarce and will depend on the local climate.
