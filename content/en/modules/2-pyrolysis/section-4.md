## **Environmental impact of pyrolysis**

The environmental impact from operating a pyrolysis plant arise from 3 elements:
- the capital term, manufacturing and disposal of the reactor and surrounding equipment (including dryer, post combustion, flue glas cleaning, concrete slab, maintenance operations)
- the supply and use of technosphere inputs during operation (electricity, water for quenching, reaction additives if any,)
- the management of side-stream, e.g. ash/fly ash collected in cyclone and sent for disposal, waste water sent to pipes)
- direct environmental emissions (from the stack/flue gases, but also...)

These terms rarely extensively modelled... not all contribute or have same relevance for different {{< tooltip_glossary text="environmental impact categories" term_id="" tooltip_text="Environmental impact categories are areas of human concern. Examples are climate change, air pollution, water eutrophication, ozone layer depletion. They are caused by different kind of stressors released by human activities in the environment. Some pollutants can be relevant for one impact category but not for another." >}}

Overall - impact contributions is small in life cycle perspective for high-tech well-used reactors, but can be significant for low-tech reactors due to high emissions (GHG balance). 

### **The type of reactor matters: from low-tech to high-tech**



some images ... low-tech


### **Parametrized life cycle inventory datasets for 3 kind of pyrolysis reactors**

Description of the data set..

Scale to 1 kg of biochar produced... contains... bi

Contains environmental emissions from 2 reactors (low-tech & high-tech)

Need to be linked upstream with: technosphere activities for biomass, electricity, use (from a background database)

How to use it
