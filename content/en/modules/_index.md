## **An interactive flowchart** 
The flowchart above describes a biochar system, starting with the <mark>production of biomass</mark> and finishing with the <mark>end-of-life of the biochar product</mark>. Outside of the boundaries, a <mark>reference system</mark> is depicted. 

Each box or process in this flowchart is a link. By <mark>clicking on it</mark>, you will access a dedicated page with definitions, explanations, useful resources and references. Disclaimer: the goal of this knowledge compilation is not to provide all information, but specifically the information needed to asess biochar systems for environmental purposes or decision-making based on environmental condiserations. 

On each page, the information appears by increasing <mark>level of complexity</mark>: at the top, you will find definitions and overview information. The more you scroll down, specialised concepts are explained and other useful resources are provided. The levels of complexity are marked in each sections, from <mark>easy</mark> (\*) to <mark>advanced</mark> (\*\*\*).

{{< callout>}} Note: The generic flowchart results from our experience in performing LCA of various biochar systems. It is further described in our research article about assessing the co-benefits of biochar [(Azzi et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112154). {{< /callout>}}

## **What can it be used for?**

can be used to describe a project, idea, in a systematic perspective - retrospectively as well as prospective
can be used, qualitatively, to discuss a project idea... or identify potential benefits
  ---> ex. Stockholm Biochar Projet, [dropwdown]
#### **The Stockholm Biochar Project example**


can be used to foster understanding, knowledge sharing
  ---> what does it mean that "biochar effects are relative" [dropdown]

#### **Biochar effects are relative - what does it mean?**
An important aspect of environmental systems analysis - results are always relative, relative to a reference. LCA is a tool essential to make comparisons between alternatives. + explain from paper V & presentations 

can be used to... perform quantiative LCA, whether full LCA or in parts, for cradle-to-gate LCA
#### LCA - what is it.
#### Cradle-to-gate LCA of biochar - methodological challenge
