  ## **Generic flowchart** 
The flowchart above describes a biochar system, starting with the <mark>production of biomass</mark> and finishing with the <mark>end-of-life of the biochar product</mark>. Outside of the boundaries, a <mark>reference system</mark> is depicted. 

#### **Biomass production**

#### **Biomass pyrolysis**

#### **Use of tars and gases**

#### **Supply of other materials**

#### **Biochar product manufacturing**

#### **Biochar product use**

#### **Biochar product end-of-life**

{{% notice tip %}}
The flowchart is interactive. Click on a box to access a dedicated page with definitions, explanations, useful resources, data and references. The goal of this knowledge compilation is not to be a complete textbook on biochar, but specifically to provide key information for assessing biochar systems for environmental purposes or decision-making based on environmental condiserations. 
<br /><br />
On each page, the information appears by increasing <mark>level of complexity</mark>: at the top, you will find definitions and overview information. The more you scroll down, specialised concepts are explained and other useful resources are provided. The levels of complexity are marked in each sections, from <mark>easy</mark> (\*) to <mark>advanced</mark> (\*\*\*).

The flowchart above results from our experience in performing LCA of various biochar systems. It is further described in our research article about assessing the co-benefits of biochar ([Azzi et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112154)) and in the following [PhD thesis]().

## **Using the flowchart**

The flowchart can be helpful for:
- describing a project idea, in a systematic perspective - retrospectively as well as prospective
- fostering understanding and knowledge sharing
- identifying biochar effects and discussing them qualitatively
- performing quantitative life cycle assessment (LCA) studies - both cradle-to-gate or cradle-to-grave

See some examples below.

An important aspect of environmental systems analysis - results are always relative, relative to a reference. LCA is a tool essential to make comparisons between alternatives. + explain from paper V & presentations
