## Disposal options of biochar products

- define a disposal option, from a given use to either a new use (re-use) or a final disposal option (e.g. incineration, landfilling, or a permanent use like soil application)

- discuss re-use, notion of cascade 

- discuss final disposal

- enumerate some situations for various products

- uncertainty on the lifetime

## In LCA modelling

Very little has been done...

- Energy uses or landfilling, comparative LCA for water filters? 

## Disposal of other biomaterial to produce biochar...
