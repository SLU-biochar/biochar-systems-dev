## **Primary or waste biomass?**

We commonly hear that ... keywords: primary/cultivated/dedicated as opposed to secondary/by-product/waste 
The distinction is used to emphasize that using secondary biomass has limited environmental impacts.

In fact that claim refers to a subtle notion in environmental systems analysis & life-cycle assessment, a notion we call: reference land or biomass use. Synonyms: counterfactual, alternative fate, reference situation, reference fate.

There is always a reference fate, even if implicit. This becomes clear when we take as example the climate impact from burning fossil oil in an engine. Here, the implicit reference situation is that if not extracted and combusted in an engine, fossil oil would remain in the geosphere and not release any carbon (the reference emissions are therefore set to 0). This is a rather undebated assumption when it comes to fossil fuels, but as soon as we look into biomass feedstocks things get more complicated: there are often several possible reference situations. 

Peat (both horticultural and energy peat), which is sometimes considered a fossil resource, is an interesting example.
