title: "1 - Biomass production"
description: "<p>Biomass is organic matter that comes from living organisms, mainly plants and animals. Biomass is a renewable resource, in the sense that it derives - directly or indirectly - from photosynthesis. However, biomass is also a limited resource, meaning that the amounts available in a given year are finite.</p>
<p>Humans rely on biomass for a variety of services: human food, animal feed, biomaterials and bioenergy. In total, it is estimated that the human appropriation of Earth's biomass productivity is already around 30%, and it is expected to increase in future scenarios with high use of biomaterials and bioenergy.</p>"
