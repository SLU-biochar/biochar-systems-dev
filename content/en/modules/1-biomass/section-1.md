### Biomass for pyrolysis systems

Any kind of biomass can be used in pyrolysis systems, but common biomass feedstocks include: wood and wood processing by-products, agricultural crop and residues, biogenic waste from municipal waste streams, and animal manure, human faeces and sewage sludge. 

Biomass feedstocks have different properties and are available in different amounts. They also have different and variable supply-chains, which leads to differentiated environmental impacts. 

Important distictions when dealing with biomass are:

- moisture level: is it a dry (< 50%) of wet (>50%) feedstock?
- management: is a problematic feedstock?

(Choice of the biomass or choice of the pyrolysis process.. what rationale? I have a waste/undesirable product, how to best make ... I have this need, how to meet it? --> for evaluate your project, which starting point)
