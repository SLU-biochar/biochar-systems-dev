## Alternative fate, reference land or biomass use

Synonyms: counterfactual, alternative fate, reference situation, reference fate.

Some theory put simply:
- There is always a reference fate, even if implicit.
- The alternative fate determines the notion of environmental impact.

In essence, there are different types of "alternative fate":
- non-industrial use > left to decay in forest, 
- use in another industrial activity, including waste treatment activities > 

It is sometimes relevant to consider multiple alternative fates. It is crucial to always make them explicit.


Let's look at some examples to explain this:

{{< tabs name="RLBU">}}
  {{% tab name="1. Fossil oil"%}}
  The statements above become clear when we take as example the climate impact from burning fossil oil in an engine.
  
  It is clear that burning fossil oil in an engine leads to emissions of carbon dioxide. But the notion of a climate impact arises from the assumed reference fate of that fossil oil.

  Here, the implicit reference is that, if not extracted and combusted in an engine, fossil oil would remain in the geosphere and not release any carbon. In the reference situation, the emissions are set to 0.

  This is a rather undebated assumption when it comes to fossil fuels, but as soon as we look into biomass feedstocks things get more complicated: there are often several possible reference situations.
