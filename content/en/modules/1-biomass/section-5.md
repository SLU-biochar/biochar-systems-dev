## **LCA of biomass production and supply**

Environmental impacts arise from consumption of products and services, the use of natural resources, and their effects on the state of the environment. Assessing the environmental impacts of biomass production is a dedicated field of research, because of its specifities (e.g. biogenic carbon flows, crop rotations, direct and indirect land use effects). 

(a simplification of what is best practice) The LCA of biomass production and supply should include the following items:

#### 1. Supply-chain

Note: what if to produce biomass, we need biomass?

#### 2. Reference land or biomass use

It's a scenario choice - there is not an absolute/unique/objective choice.
Most important for climate impact: land use changes...

#### A word about multi-functionality: allocation & substitutions

this term shall include greenhouse gas emissions arising from all activities involved in the biomass cultivation and harvesting process, like the use of machinery and fuel, the production of fertilisers, emissions from soils following fertiliser use, machinery manufacturing and disposal.

-	Direct land use changes: this term represents emissions arising at the site of cultivation of the biomass that are related to a change in land cover or land management. This can represent the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from reforestation but also the loss of carbon in aboveground and belowground stocks when harvesting forest residues or agricultural residues. In many cases, direct land use changes are given a null value (0 emission from changes in biogenic carbon stocks), but this must be justified adequately with an explicit reference situation.

-	Biomass transport: this term shall include emissions arising from transport of the biomass from the harvest site to the biochar production site, ideally including fuel emissions, but also vehicle and road infrastructure emissions.
