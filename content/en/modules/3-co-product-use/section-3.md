## **Alternative production in LCA**

In {{< tooltip_glossary text="LCA" term_id="lca" >}}, several techniques can be applied to compare the environmental impacts of systems that produce different amounts of useful products. One of these techniques consists in expanding the boundaries of the studied system by defining an alternative mean of production for the useful co-products. In that way, whenever there is a difference in amount of product delivered, the system produce less is is known as substitutions and system expansions are used take into account the effects of differences in services provided by two or more studied systems. 

Overall, this approach requires to be able to identify equivalent products, also called substitute products. (perfect/imperfect substitutes).


This technique is further elaborated in the module on reference and background system (link). Simply, we finish on the recommendation: to whenever possible select several alternative sub, because they often lead to strong variation in the results, e.g. climate impact assessement.
