## **Systems analysis insights...**

This section describes 2 concepts commonly encountered when studying biochar systems in various case studies.

### **Biochar production constrained by energy demand**

Whenever biochar production is integrated to an energy system, the amount of biochar produced is constrained by the energy demand. In other words, the energy demand sets the potential for biochar production. This can have several implications on the biochar production level, dynamics and trends:
- q 
- q
- This can be particularly limiting for biochar production in smaller-projects, where the energy demand is small. 


Let's take as example a farm, installing a pyrolysis unit to heat its premises and produce biochar. As back-up, the farm can rely on electrical heaters to heat its premises. In that context, the farm heating demand varies daily with the weather. Over ... multi-reduced... But, the farm, if it develops, can also increase its heat demand e.g. by building... 

Difficult to know self-sufficiency of farm, with heat demand, too many variables: unknown usage, variable area of land managed, ... 

Alongside with our Lindeborgs case study, we provided code to dimension a pyrolysis plant for farm heating in a given climate, so as to maximise pyrolysis uptime and biochar production. The code is available here (gist link).
