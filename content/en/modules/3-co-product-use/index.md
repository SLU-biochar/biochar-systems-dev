title: "3 - Pyrolysis co-product use"
description: "
<p>When biochar is in focus, the co-products are the pyrolysis oil and gases.</p>
<p>In many commercial reactors, today, these products are combusted directly and a fraction of the released heat is used for <mark>sustainaing the pyrolysis</mark> reaction, <mark>drying</mark> the incoming biomass, and eventually, any excess heat can be recovered for <mark>space heating</mark>. In some cases, <mark>steam</mark> can be produced or a turbine can be added to convert thermal energy to <mark>electricity</mark>.</p>

<p>More advanced reactors can include a post-treatment step to modify the properties of the gases and oil. In these cases, the new chemicals obtained can be stored and later used as liquid fuel or material .</p>

<p>For environmental systems analysis, a key question regarding the use of co-products is to identify equivalent products on the markets, i.e. products with similar properties that they can substitute.</p>
