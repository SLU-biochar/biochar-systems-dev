## **Pyrolysis oil & gas valorised as ...**

<div class="col-md-4">

### **Heat & power**
Heat and power generation is the most readily available. Power generation is usually only economically interesting for larger plants, due to the costs associated with turbines. The dozen of plants available, in 2021, in Sweden all valorise the pyrolysis gas and oil as heat. 

Generating usable heat from the pyrolysis oil and gas is commonly implemented by adding to the pyrolysis plant, the following components: a gas burner, a combustion chamber, and a heat exchanger. Post-combustion flue gases can also go through an air filtering system before being released at the stack. 

Note that distinctions can be made even within a product category such as "heat". Across the case studies, we encountered heat as:
- District heat in Stockholm district heating network
- Space heating for farm premises & greenhouses (Lindeborgs case study)
- Drying of grain or other crop
- Cooking energy (gasifier cookstoves in Kenya)

### **Biofuel**
Production of liquid biofuel requires adding a condenser after the pyrolysis chamber. The pyrolysis oil can go through various upgrading processes, to improve its properties as a fuel. 

The remaning non-condensable gases need to be burnt: this requires a gas burner and a combustion chamber. The heat released from the combustion of non-condensable gases will generally be able to support the pyrolysis reaction, with little excess heat available for other processes.

Worth noting is that the pyrolysis conditions, such as temperature, heating rate and residence time, can be adjusted to promote the production of oil.

Today, an example of biochar production coupled with biofuel production...
- Example... do we have any?
- Upgrade of pyrolysis oil to fuel quality is also suggested as further research in scenarios for straw valorisation in Denmark (Tobbias, 2021)

### **Biochemical & biomaterial**

Similar to liquid biofuel production, pyrolysis oil can be condensed and upgraded for use as chemical or material. 

Examples of such pathways are rare today.
- Do we have any example?

Note to ourselves: often, if biofuel/biochemical/biomaterial is to be produced > can be optimised for that, as main product, and biochar becomes the secondary product, lower quantities (yield) and different properties (unknown trend)

Most biochar certificates (e.g. EBC) require that the biochar co-products to be valorised.
