### **Scientific literature** - a _selection_

Between the early 2000s and 2020, more than 15 000 research articles including the keyword <mark>biochar</mark> were published in academic journals. In 2020, about 4000 articles were published. This corresponds to more than 10 new articles every day. At this rate, it is literally impossible - for researchers as well as individuals - to read all the research that exists on biochar.

Therefore, we suggest below few <mark>major references</mark>, grouped by topics: 

{{% expandcss idLabel="general" title=" **General overview** " %}}
