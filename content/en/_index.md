  title: "About this website"
  description: "The purpose of this website is to share the insights gained from various case studies, in Sweden and beyond, but also to present methodologies, data and models for studying biochar systems."
  content: "
  The **target audience** includes students, researchers, municipalities, consultants, and industrials, regardless of their prior level of knowledge on biochar or environmental systems analysis. 
  

  This website was developed in of a 4-year research project funded by Vinnova, the Swedish innovation agency. The project evaluated the energy, climate and environmental implications of deploying biochar technologies in Sweden.


  The website is maintained by the **Bioenergy systems** research group at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). The contents are being updated with new case studies, data, and models. Contributions are welcome: either <u><a href='mailto:cecilia.sundberg@slu.se?subject=Contribution ideas for biochar-systems'> reach out to us</a></u> with suggestions, or check the <u><a href='https://github.com/SLU-biochar/biochar-systems-dev' target='_blank'>GitHub contribution guide</a></u>."

  title: "CASE STUDIES"
  content: " Why do case studies? 
  

  Biochar systems are diverse: biochar can be produced from different biomass, in many types of pyrolysis reactors, at different scales, and used in various applications, on all continents. *All these possible configurations can lead to very different environmental performances.*


  We have performed case studies in Sweden (Stockholm, Lindeborg, Uppsala, Helsingborg) and abroad (Kenya). 
  
  <!--
  - Large-scale biochar production connected to Stockholm's district heating, and biochar use as animal feed supplement and manure additive on dairy farms.
  
  - Small-scale biochar production on-farm, for drying grain, heating premises and greenhouses. 
  
  - Medium-scale biochar production from urban wood waste and use for remediation of contaminated soils
  
  - Biochar use in urban environment, whether in urban plantings, green roofs, water filters, concrete. 

  - Biochar use for individual waste water management

  - Multi-criteria GIS analysis: on which arable land is biochar most suited in Sweden?

  - Smallholder farming in Kenya: gasifier cookstove for improved cooking & biochar for improved soil fertility on degraded soils
