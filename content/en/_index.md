  title: "About this website"
  description: "This website is the last deliverable of a 4-year research project funded by the Vinnova, the Swedish innovation agency. The project evaluated the energy, climate and environmental implications of deploying biochar technologies in Sweden."
  content: " The purpose of this website is to share the insights gained from various case studies, in Sweden and beyond, but also to present methodologies, data and models for studying biochar systems. The target audience includes students, researchers, municipalities, consultants, and industrials, regardless of their prior level of knowledge on biochar or environmental systems analysis. 
  

  The website is currently maintained by the **Bioenergy systems** research group at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). The contents are meant to be updated, with new case studies, data, and models. Contributions are welcome: either <u><a href='mailto:eazzi@kth.se?subject=Contribution ideas for biochar-systems'> reach out to us</a></u> with suggestions, or check the <u>[contribution guide](https://github.com/ntropy-esa/biochar-systems-dev)</u>."

  title: "CASE STUDIES"
  content: " Why doing case studies? ...
  
  Some case studies we have performed: keywords:
  
  - Large-scale biochar production connected to Stockholm's district heating, and biochar use as animal feed supplement and manture additive on dairy farms.
  
  - Small-scale biochar production on-farm, for drying grain, heating premises and greenhouses. 
  
  - Medium-scale biochar production from urban wood waste and use for remediation of contaminated soils
  
  - Biochar use in urban environment, whether in urban plantings, green roofs, water filters, concrete. 

  - Biochar use for biofilm treatment in individual waste water management

  - GIS recommendations ...

  - Kenya - smallholder farming - cooking heat - biochar for improving fertility of tropical degraded soils
