title: "Vinnova Project: Biochar systems analysis for climate change mitigation"
description: "Between 2017 and 2021, the Vinnonva-funded research project was carried out at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The project was called *Biochar - systems analysis for climate change mitigation*. The project evaluated the energy, climate and environmental implications of deploying biochar technologies in Sweden. 


In January 2022, the project was concluded with a PhD dissertation and a synthesis day. Recordings of these events are available below."

  title: "About this website"
  description: "This website is the last deliverable of a 4-year research project (2016-03392) funded by Vinnova , the Swedish innovation agency. The project evaluated the energy, climate and environmental implications of deploying biochar technologies in Sweden."
  content : "
  The **purpose** of this website is to share the insights gained from various case studies, in Sweden and beyond, but also to present methodologies, data and models for studying biochar systems.
  

  The **target audience** includes students, researchers, municipalities, consultants, and industrials, regardless of their prior level of knowledge on biochar or environmental systems analysis. 
  

  The website is currently maintained by the **Bioenergy systems** research group at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). The contents are meant to be updated, with new case studies, data, and models. Contributions are welcome: either <u><a href='mailto:cecilia.sundberg@slu.se?subject=Contribution ideas for biochar-systems'> reach out to us</a></u> with suggestions, or check the <u><a href='https://github.com/SLU-biochar/biochar-systems-dev' target='_blank'>GitHub contribution guide</a></u>.

        <p>On January 26th 2022, a biochar synthesis day was held to close the research project. Two recordings from this synthesis day are made available: </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Practical research insights</b>: This recording gathers research insights about biochar production & use, from the perspective of life cycle assessment & industrial ecology. It provides practical insights by biochar stakeholders like energy utilities, biochar product developers, farmers, municipalities or other decision-makers.</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>Biochar projects in Sweden up to 2021</b>: several biochar stakeholders in Sweden are presenting their past, current & future activities. It includes both biochar producers, biochar product developers, as well as some biochar-product consumers.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The synthesis day gathered 90+ participants from Sweden and abroad. Several areas of future work and new projects were presented, including the 4-year project funded by the Swedish Energy Agency on biochar stability, and the 3rd phase of the Rest till BÃ¤st project. 
        </p>
        <p>
        All project participants noted the very rapid development of the biochar sector in Sweden between 2017 and 2022.
