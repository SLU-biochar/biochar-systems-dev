title: "Why and where to apply biochar in Sweden: exploring different narratives"

description: "
*What was our motivation?*


Biochar is known to have positive effects on agronomy and various soil properties (e.g. pH, structure, nutrient, water). Here, we wanted to identify where in Sweden biochar application could be beneficial, and lead to e.g. improvements in soil quality, reduction in nitrogen leaching, or improvements in resilience to drought.

  - info : "In the next step, we will consult Swedish stakeholders for their opinion on the multi-criteria analysis and the priority maps and develep it futher through a Master's thesis project"

### Abstract 

The biochar-agriculture nexus can potentially generate several benefits ranging from soil carbon sequestration to the reduction in nutrient leaching from arable soils. However, leveraging these benefits requires spatially-explicit information on suitable locations for biochar application. 

This study provides a flexible multicriteria framework that delivers spatial indications on biochar prioritization through a biochar use indication map (BUIM). The framework was exemplified as a case study for Swedish arable land through three different prioritization narratives. 

The BUIM for all the narratives revealed that a significant fraction of the Swedish arable land could potentially benefit from biochar application. Furthermore, arable land that scored high for a given narrative did not necessarily score high in the others, thus indicating that biochar application schemes can be adjusted to various objectives and local needs.

The framework presented here aims to promote the exploration of different avenues for deploying biochar in the agricultural sector.
