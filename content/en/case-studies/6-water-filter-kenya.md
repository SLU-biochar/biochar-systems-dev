title: "Biochar and Moringa seed proteins for greywater treatment"
description: "
*What was our motivation?*


We set out to develop a low-cost, locally appropriate, nature-based greywater treatment using biochar and Moringa seed proteins to tackle water scarcity, reduce women’s and children’s water burdens, and enable safe reuse of water in rural Kenya while answering key questions on performance, sustainability, and community adoption." # a text describing the motivations, the context, the research questions, attratively

  ### Funding
  Moringa Biochar is funded by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning.

  ### Abstract 

  This project developed and tested a low-cost, nature-based greywater treatment system for rural households in Kenya by combining biochar, produced locally in gasifier cookstoves, with proteins extracted from Moringa oleifera seeds. Laboratory protocols optimised in Sweden were adapted to local conditions and tested in ten households across Kwale and Siaya counties. The approach targeted removal of organic pollutants, nutrients, and heavy metals from greywater generated by laundry activities, enabling safe reuse for irrigation and reducing pressure on freshwater resources. The work aligns with circular bioeconomy principles, promotes community participation, and offers potential co-benefits such as carbon storage and nutrient recycling.
  

  ### Methodology
  Laboratory optimisation: Developed a treatment protocol combining Moringa oleifera seed protein extract and biochar, assessing removal of pharmaceuticals, surfactants, nutrients, and heavy metals.

  Field trials in Kenya: Ten households, all experienced in biochar production, tested two treatment methods:

  1. Batch stirring: sequential mixing, flocculation, settling, and cloth filtration.

  2. Layered filtration: Moringa pre-treatment followed by filtration through sand, biochar, and cotton layers.

  Data collection: On-site measurements (colour, turbidity, pH, TDS, nutrients, iron) and laboratory analysis at the University of Nairobi.

  Sustainability assessment: Life cycle thinking approach to evaluate environmental benefits, resource efficiency, and safe disposal options for spent material.

  Community engagement: Hands-on farmer training, co-learning, and adaptation of equipment for local use.

  ### Key Findings
  Achieved up to 90% turbidity, 85% phosphate, and 75% nitrate removal, with notable heavy metal reductions.

  Local detergent type and water characteristics influenced treatment efficiency.

  Biochar–Moringa systems aligned well with circular bioeconomy principles, offering resource efficiency, waste minimisation, and carbon storage potential.

  Farmers developed improvised filter units, increasing local ownership and adoption potential.

  Safe disposal or reuse of spent filter material identified as a key sustainability challenge.

  ### Impact and Next Steps
  Impact: Improved greywater quality for safe irrigation, reduced freshwater demand, and alleviated women’s and children’s water collection burdens.

  Scalability: Potential for wider rural adoption through training, subsidies, and private-sector involvement in local filter production.

  Environmental benefits: Prevents contaminant discharge to ecosystems, stores carbon in biochar, and promotes nutrient recycling.

  Next steps: Optimise treatment for specific contaminants, standardise dosing methods, pilot large-scale deployment, and establish guidelines for safe reuse and disposal of spent filter materials.
