*What was our motivation?*


Biochar has been shown to have large positive effects on degraded tropical soils. Early biochar research actually comes from tropical agriculture. But, how to produce biochar in these regions? What other socio-environmental effects can be obtained?

### Project summary 

Biochar produced in cookstoves can contribute to negative carbon emissions through sequestration of biomass carbon, while also providing clean renewable energy and increasing yields in tropical agriculture.

In this research project the production and use of biochar in 150 smallholder farming households in three different regions in Kenya is investigated. Biochar-producing cookstoves have been distributed and the fuel use efficiency, emissions and biochar production are quantified. Effects on crop yields after application of biochar to soil is also studied.

Results show that cookstoves provided benefits through reduced smoke, savings on fuel wood and production of char, but challenges were found related to labour for fuel preparation, lighting, and refilling of stoves.

On-farm trials with varying rates of biochar application to soils show significant increases in maize yield both in combination and without mineral fertilization. Yield increases are persistent according to our results from an ongoing long-term trial which was started in 2006. More recent participatory trials where the farmers used their own biochar from the cookstoves also showed positive correlations between biochar rates and yields.

The climate impact in a life cycle perspective is quantified, taking biomass production and use, cookstove efficiency and biochar use in agriculture into account. Climate benefits are possible through reduced use of biomass in cooking, reduced emissions and sequestration of stable biochar carbon in soils.

The farmers perceptions of the technology and the reasons for changes in practices are also investigated in the project.
