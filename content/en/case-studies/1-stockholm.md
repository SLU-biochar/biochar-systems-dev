title: "Prospective life cycle assessment of large-scale biochar production and use for negative emissions in Stockholm"
description: "
*What was our motivation?*


Stockholm has a large district heating network to provide thermal comfort during winter times. Over the past decades, the fuel mix of the heating network was heavily decarbonised, moving away from coal and oil to favor biomass, large-scale heat pumps, and waste. What could be the next step for further reducing the climate change impact of Stockholms's energy system? Is it climate-suitable to invest in a large-scale biochar plant or should we invest in conventional bioenergy technologies? That was the context of this case study, performed in 2017-2019." # a text describing the motivations, the context, the research questions, attratively

### Abstract 

Several cities in Sweden are aiming for climate neutrality within a few decades and for negative emissions thereafter. Combined biochar, heat, and power production is an option to achieve carbon sequestration for cities relying on biomass-fuelled district heating, while biochar use could mitigate environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. By using prospective life cycle assessment, the climate impact of the pyrolysis of woodchips in Stockholm is compared with two reference scenarios based on woodchip combustion. The pyrolysis of woodchips produces heat and power for the city of Stockholm, and biochar whose potential use as a feed and manure additive on Swedish dairy farms is explored. The climate change mitigation trade-off between bioenergy production and biochar carbon sequestration in Stockholm’s context is dominated by the fate of marginal power. If decarbonisation of power is achieved, building a new pyrolysis plant becomes a better climate option than conventional combustion. Effects of cascading biochar use in animal husbandry are uncertain but could provide 10–20% more mitigation than direct biochar soil incorporation. These results help design regional biochar systems that combine negative carbon dioxide emissions with increased methane and nitrous oxide mitigation efforts and can also guide the development of minimum performance criteria for biochar products.

  In the article, we used 3 time periods to describe the marginal electricity mix (2020: coal-dominated, 2030: coal and natural gas mix, 2040; efficient natural gas). This was based on a report from , and their specific methodology. Altough both the modelling and the time frame suggested can be discussed, the conclusion that remains is that: biochar is rarely preferable over bioenergy in a fossil energy system. It is even counter-productive. Later, we recalculated these results with the current Swedish average mix for electricity (cf. thesis). The climate-relevance of the energy-biochar trade-off is in that case much less important.
