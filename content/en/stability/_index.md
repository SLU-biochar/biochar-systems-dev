title: "Research Project / Biochar Stability"
description: "<p>Biochar can contribute to negative greenhouse gas emissions in the form of long-term carbon storage. It is important for the development of the biochar market to strengthen the knowledge around biochar stability in soils over long times and to develop ways of accounting for biochar stability. </p>

<p>This 4-year research project, named <i>Biochar Stability: supporting transparent & reliable carbon removal</i>, is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency.<p>

## Background
Biochar produced from biomass has large potential to provide negative greenhouse gas emissions as a stable carbon sink in soil. A major hurdle for biochar market establishment is the limited knowledge about the stability of biochar over longer time periods.

## Research objectives

* Knowledge on biochar stability in Swedish agricultural soils
* Field trials established for long-term evaluation of biochar stability
* Open database for international research data on biochar stability
* New models for calculation of biochar stability based on biochar properties and environmental conditions
* Practical guidelines on how to use the stability models developed

## Timeline and work packages

The project has 5 work packages (WP):
* WP1: Stakeholders & guidelines
* WP2: Biochar characterisation
* WP3: Laboratory incubations
* WP4: Field trials
* WP5: Data analysis

The project started in january 2022, and will continue until year 2025:
* Year 2022: survey & roundtables with stakeholders (WP1) / biochar collection & characterisation (WP2) / experiment design (WP3-4) / litterature data collection, modelling toochain, and first re-analysis (WP5)
* Year 2023: initial guidelines (WP1-5) / start of incubation (WP3) / start of field trials (WP4) / uncertainty modelling (WP5)
* Year 2024: continued laboratory and field work (WP3-4)
* Year 2025: update of guidelines (WP1-5)
