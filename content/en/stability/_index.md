title: "Research Project / Biochar Stability"
description: "<p>Biochar can contribute to negative greenhouse gas emissions in the form of long-term carbon storage. It is important for the development of the biochar market and biochar policy to strengthen the knowledge around biochar stability in soils over long times and to develop ways of accounting for biochar stability. </p>

<p>This 4-year research project, named <i>Biochar Stability: supporting transparent & reliable carbon removal</i>, is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency. It started in March 2022 and is finishing in December 2025.<p>

## Background
Biochar produced from biomass has large potential to provide negative greenhouse gas emissions as a stable carbon sink in soil alongside other climate change mitigation benefits. A hurdle for biochar deployment at scale has been the knowledge about the stability of biochar over longer time periods, also referred to as persistence or durability.

_This project aimed at consolidating the knowledge around biochar carbon storage in soils._

## Research objectives (as stated in 2022)

* Knowledge on biochar stability in Swedish agricultural soils
* Field trials established for long-term evaluation of biochar stability
* Open database for international research data on biochar stability
* New models for calculation of biochar stability based on biochar properties and environmental conditions
* Practical guidelines on how to use the stability models developed

## Research outputs (as of 2025-06-30)

* _Scientific article_. December 2024. [Can inert pool models improve predictions of biochar long-term persistence in soils?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2024.117093) Geoderma, 452, 117093. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2024.117093

* _Scientific article_. January 2024. [Modelling biochar long-term carbon storage in soil with harmonized analysis of decomposition data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116761) Geoderma, 441, 116761 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116761

* _Dataset and code_. December 2023. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SLU-biochar/biocharStability) for the biochar decay dataset and python code for reproducing analyses. https://github.com/SLU-biochar/biocharStability

* _Background report_. December 2023. Guidelines for estimation of biochar durability. See: [biochar.systems/stability/guidelines]({{< ref "stability/guidelines.md" >}})

* _Public statement_. June 2023. At the Biochar Summit in Helsinborg, we published a short non-technical statement synthesizing current knowledge on durability, resulting from 2 months of discussions between researchers in the field. Access it here: [biochar.systems/durability-statement]({{< ref "durability-statement/_index.md" >}})

* _Conferences & Seminars_. Project team has contributed to a series a scientific conferences, seminars and workshops on the topic of biochar persistence, such as: EU CRCF Workshops & Meetings 2024, Biochar Summit 2023/2025, EGU 2023, EGU 2022, Negative Emission Conference 2022, 2nd Swedish Conference on Sewage Sludge biochar 2024.


### Activities on-going and planned
Several activities on-going and new ones are planned in 2025:
* Laboratory incubations with non-labelled Swedish biochars started in February 2022 have been concluded. Analysis of data is on-going.
* Laboratory incubations with novel labelled biochar started in September 2023 is on-going. Characterisation and other analyses are on-going.
* Field trials have been established at Ultuna, Uppsala in 2023. Data collection is ongoing.
* Update of recommendations and review of new research findings is planned for 2025.
