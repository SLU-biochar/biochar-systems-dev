## Storyline 1 - I have biomass available...

You have access to some biomass feedstock, and you want to valorise it. Can pyrolysis be an option? What could the biochar and other pyrolysis co-products be used for in your case?

### 1. Characterising the biomass stream

This section will help you characterise the biomass stream. There are 
- What kind of biomass is available? Is it from one or multiple sources? e.g. 
- When is the biomass available? e.g. 
- How much biomass is produced? e.g. 
- How wet is the biomass?
- Is it already pre-processed (dried, chipped, filter)?
- Are there any major impurities? e.g. sand beachcast / plastic contamination -
- Where is the biomass located & is it already collected?

An important aspect when assessing biomass' environmental impact is its potential alternative fate (internal link to page). 
- Would you dedscribe this biomass as being a waste product (secondary) or as primary (i.e. land used dedicated for biomass production)?
> feedback: secondary/primary
- Current biomass or land fate: what is the current fate of the biomass? Note: there is always a current fate, e.g. left to decay on site (i.e. becomes energy for microorganisms in the soil), sent to a waste management company, used for energy on-site, burnt on site without energy recovery.
- Possible biomass or land fate: what could be done with the land or biomass? Note: it is good practice to consider several possible fates? This could be: e.g. mulching, liquid biofuel, combustion for heating, 


### 2. Is pyrolysis an option?

Can pyrolysis be used to treat your feedstock? Should it be done by your organisation or by a third-party? All this is likely to depend on your specific context.


Do you have a need for biochar? Do you have a need for the pyrolysis co-products?

## Storyline 2 - I have an energy need...

You have a need for some energy service, e.g. heating of premises, steam generation, or even biofuel. You want to know whether you should meet that energy need by biomass pyrolysis?

### 1. Characterising the energy need

- questions


Criteria in favor for pyrolysis:

Alternative heat source: current & possible?


### 2. What biomass source and biochar use?

Own biomass or getting from elsewhere?

Own biochar use, or selling to a wholesaler?

### 3. Summary & useful resources 


## Storyline 3 - I want to include biochar in my products...

You are developing and selling some kind of material product. You would like to consider whether biochar could be a component of your next product? 



## Storyline 4 - I am an investor or decision-maker... 

You have heard about biochar, and you would like to invest or support a biochar project. Alternatively, you are a decision-maker or an consulting, and you have to decide whether or not to proceed with a biochar project, but lack an expertise in that area? The checklist below will try to get you covered.
