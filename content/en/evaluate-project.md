## Storyline 1 - I have biomass available...

You have access to some biomass resource, and you want to valorise it. Can pyrolysis be an option? What would you use the biochar and other pyrolysis co-products for? Shall you produce biochar yourself or send your biomass somewhere else? 

Go through the steps below to better define your case.

#### 1. Characterising the biomass stream

This section will help you characterise the biomass stream. Try to answer the following questions:
- What kind of biomass is available? Is it from one or multiple sources? e.g. 
- When is the biomass available? e.g. 
- How much biomass is produced? e.g. 
- How wet is the biomass?
- Is it already pre-processed (dried, chipped, filter)?
- Are there any major impurities? e.g. sand beachcast / plastic contamination -
- Where is the biomass located & is it already collected?
- Will the biomass be available for many years (secured long term supply) to fuel a pyrolysis plant?

An important aspect when assessing biomass' environmental impact is its potential alternative fate (internal link to page). 
- Would you dedscribe this biomass as being a waste product (secondary) or as primary (i.e. land used dedicated for biomass production)?
> feedback: secondary/primary
- Current biomass or land fate: what is the current fate of the biomass? Note: there is always a current fate, e.g. left to decay on site (i.e. becomes energy for microorganisms in the soil), sent to a waste management company, used for energy on-site, burnt on site without energy recovery.
- Possible biomass or land fate: what could be done with the land or biomass? Note: it is good practice to consider several possible fates? This could be: e.g. mulching, liquid biofuel, combustion for heating, 


#### 2. Is pyrolysis an option?

Can pyrolysis be used to treat your feedstock? Should it be done by your organisation or by a third-party? All this is likely to depend on your specific context.

Do you have a need for the pyrolysis co-products? If not, it may be tricky to store & sell the pyrolysis co-products, in projects of smaller scale.

Do you have a need for biochar? If not, you could sell the biochar.

## Storyline 2 - I have an energy need...

You have a need for some energy service, e.g. heating of premises, steam generation, or even biofuel. You want to know whether you should meet that energy need by biomass pyrolysis?

#### 1. Characterising the energy need

- questions


Criteria in favor for pyrolysis:

Alternative heat source: current & possible?


#### 2. What biomass source and biochar use?

Own biomass or getting it from elsewhere?

Own biochar use, or selling to a wholesaler/intermediary?

## Storyline 3 - I want biochar in my products...

*You are developing and selling some kind of material product. You would like to consider whether biochar could be a component of your next product?*

#### Step 1. Identifying tangible benefits for your products

The main driver for including some biochar in your product formulation should be to create a product i) with specific desired properties and ii) an improved environmental performance relative to alternative equivalent products.

Ideally, the main driver should not be to sequester carbon nor to "offset" the greenhouse gas emissions of the product via the biochar carbon sink – this should be seen as a secondary effect.

##### **i) Properties of your product that biochar could affect**

You can think in terms of:

- Physico-chemical: bulk density, porosity, nutrient content, ash content, water holding capacity, nutrient holding capacity, sorption, adsorption, surface area, colour, odour, particle size, sieving profile, pH, elemental content

- Mechanical properties: elasticity, tensile strength, elongation, hardness and fatigue 

- Biological properties: habitat, enhanced or inhibition of activity

What implications does this have on the type of biochar you will use? 

##### **ii) Improved environmental performance**

Improved environmental performance of a product is always relative to one or multiple references (see our explanation on the relativeness of effects [here]({{< ref "modules/_index.md#using-the-flowchart" >}})). 

The first step here is to consider what alternative products can serve as a benchmark. This can be a product without biochar, whether it is the current generation of a product you are selling, or another version under development. It can also be a product with another type of biochar, as biochars do not have the same properties.

Environmental effects can be of several types:
- Change in technosphere inputs: product manufacturing uses different materials or different amounts, e.g. biochar-compost blend replacing peat substrate, lower fertiliser requirement
  
- Change in biosphere exchanges: direct environmental emissions are different, e.g. biological processeses affected, water filtering function
  
- Change in technosphere outputs: more service is delivered by a unit of product, e.g. increased product lifetime or durability, higher product efficiency

You can read more about biochar effect identification in our dedicated paper (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112154" target="_blank">Azzi et al. 2021</a>)

#### Step 2. Producing or buying biochar?

At first, we recommend buying biochar. It's usually easier, allows for development & testing of biochar-products. However, you should pay attention to what kind of biochar you get, in relation to the material properties you need (identified above) & the transparency of the supplier regarding biomass sourcing, production process conditions, and certifications.


## Storyline 4 - I am an investor or decision-maker... 

You have heard about biochar, and you would like to invest or support a biochar project. Alternatively, you are a decision-maker or a consultant, and you have to decide whether or not to proceed with a biochar project? 

Ideally, you could have a look at our overall biochar system description

And scan the 3 storylines above
