### **Data for direct environmental emissions**

Data on direct environmental emissions from pyrolysis reactor is rather scarce. However, we compiled data from 3 sources for different pyrolysis reactors. 

The inventory data is scaled for 1 kg of biochar produced. It can be used in LCA, however, it should be noted that (i) the scope of environmental stressors considered is different in the three datasets, and that (ii) the measurements were performed for different biomass feedstocks, which has a influence on the kind of emissions. 

Further descriptions & references are provided in the dataset:

### **Data for technosphere inputs**

Data on manufacturing, disporal, and operation requirements of pyrolysis reactor is rather scarce as well. Through modelling, we compiled some inventory data for different reactors.
