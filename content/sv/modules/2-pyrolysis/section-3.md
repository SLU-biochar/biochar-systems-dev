## **LCA of biomass pyrolysis**

The environmental impact from operating a pyrolysis plant can be decomposed in the following terms:

- Manufacturing and disposal of the pyrolysis reactor and surrounding equipment (e.g. dryer, silos, feeder, combustion, flue glas cleaning, concrete slab, as well as maintenance operations)
  
- The supply and use of industrial products needed for operation of the pyrolysis reactor (e.g. electricity, quenching water, reaction additives, or other consumables)
  
- Management of side-stream, mostly waste such as ash and fly ash collected in flue gas cleaning system, or wastewater sent to treatment
  
- Other fuel and equipment use for handling of the biomass on site (e.g. wheel-loaders)
  
- Other fuel and equipment use for handling of the pyrolysis products (biochar, and pyrolysis gas and oil if stored rather than directly combusted)

- Direct environmental emissions from the operations, like dust from handling of biochar or air pollutant emissions from the stack of the pyrolysis reactor

In the LCA of pyrolysis processes, these terms can be very different and have varying importance for different  {{< tooltip_glossary text="environmental impact categories" term_id="" tooltip_text="Environmental impact categories are areas of human concern. Examples are climate change, air pollution, water eutrophication, ozone layer depletion. They are caused by different kind of stressors released by human activities in the environment. Some pollutants can be relevant for one impact category but not for another." >}}. The importance of the terms are also affected by the context:

- Reactor type: the type of reactor (low-tech or high-tech, electricity-heated or syngas-heated pyrolysis) affects for instance the direct environmental emissions and the amount of inputs needed to operate the reactor. 

- Context dependence: an electricity-heated reactor supplied with electricity from coal will not have the same environmental performance than one supplied with hydropower. 

- Environmental impact categories: a low-tech reactor may have higher direct emissions, which are relevant for human health impacts but also climate change. A high-tech reactor running on nuclear energy may have a low climate change impact, but a high impact in ionising radiations.
