              <br /> - varying moisture, usually high moisture content which requires drying before pyrolysis
              <br /> - often seen as a problem, due to potentially high contents of heavy metals, but also an important source of nutrients
              <br /> - alternative uses includes application to agricultural land, incineration, or landfilling
