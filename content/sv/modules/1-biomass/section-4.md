## Alternative fate, reference land or biomass use

Synonyms: counterfactual, alternative fate, reference situation, reference fate.

Some theory put simply:
<ol>
<li>There is always a reference fate, even if implicit.</li>
<li>The alternative fate determines the notion of environmental impact.</li>
<li>It is sometimes relevant to consider multiple alternative fates.</li>
<li>It is crucial to always make them explicit.</li>
<li>There are two main types of "alternative fate": non-industrial use (i.e. not extracted from the environment and not used in the economy) & industrial use (i.e. used in the economy)</li>
<ol>

Let's look at some examples to explain this:

{{< tabs name="RLBU">}}
  {{% tab name="1. Fossil oil"%}}
  The theory becomes clearer when we take as example the climate impact from burning fossil oil in an engine.
  
  It is clear that burning fossil oil leads to emissions of carbon dioxide. But the notion of a climate impact arises from the assumed reference fate of that fossil oil.

  Here, the implicit reference is that, if not extracted and combusted in an engine, fossil oil would remain in the geosphere and not release any carbon to the atmosphere. In the reference situation, the emissions are equal to 0.
    


  This is a rather undebated reference fate when it comes to fossil fuels, but as soon as we look into biomass feedstocks things get more complicated: there are often several possible reference situations.

  {{% tab name="2. Peat"%}}
  Peat is a material extracted from water-clogged ecosystems either for energy or horticultural use. In some countries, it is considered a fossil fuel & its use is associated with a high climate change impact.

  Peat is formed by the slow accumulation of dead biomass in the upper soil layers of an environment that does not allow its decomposition (water filled, low oxygen, low nutrient, or high acidity environments). Peat in the environment is thereby a stock of carbon. 

  Harvesting of peat usually involves the drainage of the peatland, and therefore its exposure to oxygen, leading to release of carbon dioxide in the field but also during the use of the peat.

  Here, the mainly accepted reference fate for peat is: if peat is not extracted, it remains stable in the environment (like oil from the geosphere, in example 1). Thereby, its extraction and use lead to carbon emissions that can be attributed to this activity. 

  However, the peat industry has sometimes claimed that peat being already drained, the carbon emissions would happen even if not harvested, and therefore these greenhouse gas emissions should not be accounted for in the climate impact of peat. This is another reference land use.

  An objection to this statement is to consider that if peat is not extracted, the peatland can also be rehabilitated.
