### Biomass for pyrolysis systems

Any kind of biomass can be used for pyrolysis, but common biomass feedstocks include:
- wood and wood processing by-products, 
- agricultural crop and residues, 
- marine biomass, 
- biogenic waste from municipal waste streams, 
- and animal manure, human faeces and sewage sludge. 

Biomass feedstocks have different properties and are available in different amounts. They also have variable supply-chains, which leads to differentiated environmental impacts.
