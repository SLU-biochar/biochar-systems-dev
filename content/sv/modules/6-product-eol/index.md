title: "6 - Avfallshantering av biokolprodukter"
description: "

In most cases, a biochar product has a fixed service life. Biochar product disposal (aka end-of-life) refers to all handling that may occur until the materials are reused in other products (e.g. re-use of soil masses) or disposed in a final application (e.g. landfilling or soil amendement).


The biochar product disposal plays an important role because it is the phase that guarantees the biochar carbon sink property (i.e. biochar is not burnt). The environment in which the biochar is placed also influences its stability.
