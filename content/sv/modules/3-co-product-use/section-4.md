## **Alternative production in LCA**

In {{< tooltip_glossary text="LCA" term_id="lca" >}}, several techniques can be applied to compare the environmental impacts of systems that produce different amounts of useful products. One of these techniques consists in expanding the boundaries of the studied system by defining an alternative mean of production for the useful co-products. In that way, whenever there is a difference in amount of products delivered, substitutions or system expansions are used to equalise productions and restore comparability. 

Overall, this approach requires to identify equivalent products, also called substitute products (including cases of perfect/imperfect substitutes).

This technique is further elaborated in the module on [reference and background system]({{< ref "modules/7-ref-bg-systems.md" >}}). The main recommendation is to select several alternative products, whenever possible, because they often lead to strong variation in the results. Rather than being interpreted as uncertainty, one can see see variations induced by choice of substitution as the fact that environmental performance depends on the overall context.
